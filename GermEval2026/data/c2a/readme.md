# Call to Action

This subdirectory contains the data for the first subtask of the shared task on "Harmful Content Detection in Social Media" within GermEval 2026: **binary detection of calls to action**.

## Data annotation

The dataset contains all tweets for which a majority of the three to four annotators decided whether a tweet was a call to action (TRUE) or not (FALSE). A call to action is understood to be, based on the definition of the [Oxford Dictionaries](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/call-to-action), an order or request for a specific action or behaviour. The behaviour that a call to action encourages or incites may, but does not have to be, criminally relevant. For example, it may also be a call for a demonstration or political campaign, such as distributing leaflets.

## Origin and structure of the data

The **training data** for GermEval 2025 has been expanded to 15,915 tweets. The data set consists of posts and comments from a right-wing extremist movement from 12/12/2014 to 07/07/2016. The dataset is provided as a CSV file that includes the ID, text, and call-to-action label. Each entry therefore has the following format:

"id";"description";"c2a";<br />
"1064396393598783";"Oliver, ich guck doch schon mindestens einmal die Woche RTL2-NEWS.";"false";

The **test dataset** contains 2,982 tweets. It is identical to the GermEval 2025 test set to allow direct comparability between editions. The test data is also distributed as a CSV file, containing an ID and the tweet text: 
"id";"description."

## Anonymization of data

To anonymise the mentions in the data set (training and test data) were replaced as follows:

* mentions of the press/press offices/news portals: [@PRE]
* mentions of the police/police authorities: [@POL]
* mentions of groups/organisations/associations: [@GRP]
* mentions of individuals: [@IND]

For example, the mentions of the organisation Greenpeace and the TV channel ARD in the following (fictitious) tweet would be replaced as follows: @greenpeace_de Euch liegt bei euren Aktionen wohl etwas an Sicherheit. Da muss man sich ja nur die letzte Doku ansehen, um das zu merken *@ARDde* => *[@GRP]* Euch liegt bei euren Aktionen wohl etwas an Sicherheit. Da muss man sich ja nur die letzte Doku ansehen, um das zu merken *[@PRE]*

No further preprocessing steps were performed on the data.
