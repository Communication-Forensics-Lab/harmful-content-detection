# Additional annotation

In addition to the annotations required for this shared task, the dataset was annotated for **hate speech, toxicity, targets**, and **emotions** to support the classification tasks. The additional annotations can be used, for example, as features or in the context of multi-task learning. The IDs can be used to link to the tweets in the subtask data.

Further information, a more detailed description of the annotation, and a sample of the data will follow shortly.
