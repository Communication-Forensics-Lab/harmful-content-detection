The Large Language Model Qwen2.5, with 32 billion parameters, was used as the baseline for violence detection. The LLM was tasked with binary classification of tweets in a few-shot scenario. The LLM was assigned the role of a filter system specialised in detecting harmful content on social media via a system prompt. It was also provided with a definition of ‘call to definition’ that was essentially the same as the one given to the annotators. The examples required for in-context learning are the same as those available on the website and presented to the annotators. The script is intended for LLMs running locally with Ollama.
