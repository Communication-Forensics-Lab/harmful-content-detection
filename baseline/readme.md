# Baseline systems

[//]: # ( A **Large Language Model** that performed the classification in a zero-shot setting was used as the baseline system for all subtasks. Qwen2.5 with a size of 32 B was selected as the model. In the results presented below, the Macro-F1 measure is the main evaluation measure. This is also used for the ranking in the leaderboard. In addition, we also report precision, recall and F1 measures for the individual classes.)

## Call to Action

A gradient-boosting classifier was trained as the baseline system, using sentence embeddings extracted from SentenceBert and the polarity of the tweet as features. Polarity was determined using a lexicon-based approach with the TextBlob programme. Undersampling was applied to address the high imbalance of the training dataset.
