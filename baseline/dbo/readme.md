# Baseline system - Attacks on the Basic Democratic Order

A **gradient-boosting classifier** was trained as the baseline system. The system is based on two features: sentence embeddings created with SentenceBert (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019) and the polarity of the tweets, which was determined using a lexicon-based approach with the TextBlob programme (Loria, 2025). 

The Jupyter notebook `dbo_baseline.ipynb` contains the code for training the model and for making predictions on unseen data.

## Results 

The system achieved the following metrics on the test data, with the Macro-F1 metric being decisive for the ranking on the leaderboard. 

| Category      |   P  |   R  |  F1  |
| ------------- | ---- | ---- |  -:  |
| agitation     | 0.04 | 0.01 | 0.01 |
| criticism     | 0.33 | 0.05 | 0.08 |
| nothing       | 0.85 | 0.98 | 0.91 |
| subversive    | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |
| **Mac. avg.** | 0.30 | 0.26 | 0.25 |
| **Weight. avg.** | 0.75 | 0.83 | 0.78 |
