# Harmful Content Detection

This repository contains the annotated datasets and baseline systems for the shared tasks of the **GermEval editions 2025** and **2026**.

In the **first edition (GermEval 2025)**, the following three subtasks were addressed:

1. Binary detection of call-to-action statements
2. Fine-grained classification of attacks on the free democratic basic order in Germany
3. Binary detection of violence-related statements in tweets

The **second edition (GermEval 2026)** builds on the first and provides expanded datasets for the existing subtasks. This allowed the third subtask to be redesigned as a **fine-grained classification, distinguishing** different forms of violence-related statements. In addition, a fourth subtask for detecting **defamatory offences** under the German Criminal Code was introduced.

The datasets for both editions, as well as further details on the subtasks and data formats, are available in the respective subdirectories.
